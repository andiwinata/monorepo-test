# Learning in monorepo:

- Adding local package dependency using yarn -> needs to specify version otherwise it will fail
  - https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/4878
- Structuring webpack and monorepo
  - https://medium.com/@Georgian/webpack-4-config-for-lerna-monorepo-using-babel-7-and-jest-8342c4ebc239
- Intro to monorepo, example 2 packages as library also with webpack

# Update process

Example 1:
- All packages start with v1.0.1
- When `orange` added a new function that is not used for main then committed it
- Since `main` is dependant on `orange`, when running `lerna changed`, both `orange` and `main` is subject to change for next release
- Since `lerna` mode is not independent, both packages are updated to same version (leaving other package to be the same version)

Example 2:
- Packages start with v1.0.2 for `main` and `orange`
- `apple` is still in v1.0.1
- Now, change something in `apple` package and then commit it
- `lerna changed` will say both `main` and `apple` are changed
- `lerna version` will bump both `main` and `apple` to v1.0.3 (`apple` skips through v1.0.2, and leave `orange` still at v1.0.2

# Output from lerna commands:

Lerna version skipping through version:

```bash
$ D:\GitProjects\monorepo\node_modules\.bin\lerna version
lerna notice cli v3.13.1
lerna info current version 1.0.3
lerna info Looking for changed packages since v1.0.3
? Select a new version (currently 1.0.3) Patch (1.0.4)

Changes:
 - @monorepo-test/apple: 1.0.3 => 1.0.4
 - @monorepo-test/main: 1.0.3 => 1.0.4
 - @monorepo-test/orange: 1.0.2 => 1.0.4

? Are you sure you want to create these versions? Yes
lerna info execute Skipping GitHub releases
lerna info git Pushing tags...
lerna success version finished

```

Testing since the latest release change: (this case there is a change in `apple` package)
https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/core/filter-options

```bash
$ yarn lerna run test --since
yarn run v1.12.3
$ D:\GitProjects\monorepo\node_modules\.bin\lerna run test --since
lerna notice cli v3.13.1
lerna info Looking for changed packages since v1.0.4
lerna info Executing command in 2 packages: "yarn run test"

lerna info run Ran npm script 'test' in '@monorepo-test/main' in 0.3s:
$ echo 'main' && exit 0

lerna success run Ran npm script 'test' in 2 packages in 0.7s:
lerna success - @monorepo-test/apple
lerna success - @monorepo-test/main
Done in 1.52s.
```

## Publishing dependencies

- `lerna version` relies on `lerna changed`
- `lerna` will always look for git tag, so without git tag every packages will be treated as changed

- Use verdaccio to test private repository

```bash
# Command that has been tried
yarn lerna version --no-git-tag-version
# this one is looking both at git tag and package.json
# Though this wont be nice if you are using private repo
# lerna WARN Unable to determine published version, assuming "@monorepo-test/main" unpublished.
# lerna WARN Unable to determine published version, assuming "@monorepo-test/apple" unpublished.
# lerna WARN Unable to determine published version, assuming "@monorepo-test/orange" unpublished.
yarn lerna publish from-package
yarn lerna publish
```

## Next attempt

- In a branch, do `lerna version --no-git-tag-version`
- Then manually commit and push
- Then in master do something to tag previous commit
- But what is that something (?)
- Running `lerna version` and `lerna publish` will attempt to publish a new version ahead of the `package.json`

## Next attempt

- In the branch `fix/test-bump-main`
- Made change to `package/main` file
- Run `lerna version` to also tag the changes from (v1.0.6 to v1.0.7)
- At this point, version @monorepo-test/main@1.0.7 is registered in the repository, even though it's on the other branch

- Go back to master
- Then go make another branch `fix/test-bump-main-conflict`
- Made change to `package/main` file
- Run `lerna version` again (v1.0.6 to v1.0.7)
- (!) It blows up because the tag exists already

So learning: The tagging must happen at master, but the versioning is ideally done manually in separate branch
